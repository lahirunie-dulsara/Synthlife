# Synthlife

Synthlife is a portable and wearable stress monitoring device we developed as first year Bio Medical Engineering Undergraduates.

## Problem Definition

We started doing a survey on 18th March regarding the problems associated with mental stress. Out of the over 100 participants who took part in our survey, about 90% of the sample are aware of mental health issues. These people belonged to several age categories, with the majority being 18 - 25 years old. The survey results indicate a significant need for a portable wearable stress monitoring device in the market. With 90% of participants aware of mental health issues and a large majority experiencing stress daily or every few days, the demand for effective stress management solutions is evident. Moreover, nearly 85% of respondents expressed interest in a device that can monitor their stress levels regularly. This data shows the growing necessity for accessible, real-time stress monitoring technology, especially among young adults, making it a crucial innovation for improving mental well-being.
